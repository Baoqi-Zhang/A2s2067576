# # Question 1: Quadrature [16 marks]
# 
# In the course, we have seen Newton-Cotes interpolatory quadrature rules, which have the particular property that they use equally-spaced nodes. Other types of quadrature rules also exist.
# 
# In this question, we will consider quadrature rules with $N$ nodes, where the nodes $x_k$ are defined as the Chebyshev nodes, i.e.
# 
# $$
# x_k = \cos\left(\frac{(2k-1)\pi}{2N}\right), \quad
# k=1, \dots, N.
# $$
# 
# **1.1** Write a function `cheb_nodes()` which takes 1 input argument, a strictly positive integer `N`, and returns a NumPy vector of length $N$ containing the $N$ Chebyshev nodes, as defined above.
#

# Import numpy for use of np.arrange function

    return np.cos((2*k-1) / (2*N) * np.pi)

# Test the function when N=3

# **1.2** Write a function `cheb_weights()` which takes 1 input argument, a strictly positive integer `N`, and returns a NumPy vector of length $N$ containing the **weights** $w_k$ associated with the interpolatory quadrature rule whose nodes are the $x_k$ as defined above.

# For testing: the weights for $N = 3$ are $\left\{\frac{4}{9}, \frac{10}{9}, \frac{4}{9}\right\}$.

# ***üìù Discussion for question 1.4***
# 
# According to the first grapgh, we can see that the magnitude of error decreases shaply in the N-interval 2 to 5. Then its trend shows convergence to us. At first, it did make me quite believe that the the error will converge until the end, however, when I increase the scale of the grapgh and soar the number of nodes into the function, the plot shows obvious fluctuations in the interval between 50 and 100. This phenomenon is called 'Runge's phenomenon', which is is the problem of oscillation at the edges of an interval that occurs when using polynomial interpolation with polynomials of high degree over a set of equispaced interpolation points. The reasons are that the magnitude of the n-th order derivatives of this particular function grows quickly when n increases and the equidistance between points leads to a Lebesgue constant that increases quickly when n increases.The phenomenon is graphically obvious because both properties combine to increase the magnitude of the oscillations.The phenomenon is graphically obvious because both properties combine to increase the magnitude of the oscillations.

# # Question 2: Numerical differentiation [10 marks]
# 

# Consider a finite difference approximation 
# 
# $$
# F' \left( x \right) \approx D \left( x \right) = \frac{1}{\Delta x} \left[ -\frac{1}{8} F \left( x - 2\Delta x \right) -\frac{3}{4} F \left( x \right) + F \left( x + \Delta x \right) - \frac{1}{8} F \left( x + 2 \Delta x \right) \right].
# $$
# 
# By considering the derivative of the function $F \left( x \right) = \sin x$ at $x = 1$, perform numerical experiments to investigate the accuracy of this approximation. Your code should generate appropriate output and/or figures to illustrate the results.
# 
# Confirm your results analytically. (You can either use the Markdown cell below, or submit a PDF of your handwriting if you prefer.)

However, when alpha = 3,4,5, it will not finally converge but diverge, because step size is too large and x goes out of the interval of convergence and even out of the valid range.
